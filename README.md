# APUE-Advanced-Programming-in-Unix-Environment-
This repository contains the codes that were written as part of the course in Unix programming.
The following are the different ptogramms implemented in the unix environment using c programming language:
  1. ls - which gives the contents of the directory if specified or the current directory with some arguments.
  2. Telbook - A simple telephone dictionary searching application for understanding the commands of openat, read, write, lseek and pointer manipulation in c.
  3. File operations - Programs related to take input a name of the file and print the contents of the file, change user group, umask, percentage of files, backup of the file given source and destination.
  4. Mpcalc -  (multi process calc) that will compare two expressions of the form ab and cd and will print out which is less than (or equal to) which. These numbers (a, b, c & d) should be accepted from the user (standard input).
  5. Shell program - having the following minimum features:
        -> You should be able to execute any commands (programs) with arguments                                             
        ->  The termination status and exit status (if any) of the executed program should be reported after termination of the program.
  6. Signal Handling - Signal handling in the above program of shell.
 The book followed in the course is Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago.
